# This is a tool designed to help me make my video work flows faster. 

>Required python version is 3.12.2. At least I think. I am only operating on what I am using.

## Caveats:
* Presently being designed for use in Linux Mint / Ubuntu systems.
    >Pyautogui doesn't yet have the ability to activate and close windows, so I had to roll my own solution with a wmctrl subprocess

## Road map:
*TBD*
I guess the first order of operations is to just make a video first, and then figure out everything else that I need.
